# ProjectCS2063
The CS2063 app term project

A fitness app used to count steps and track water intake.

-Manual Water intake tracking

-Step tracking by use of accelerometer. Would have used the actual pedometer/stepcounter/stepdetector sensor but unfortunately, we had no way of testing it to make sure it funtioned. Emulated devices could not trigger the step detector sensor and we had no physical device

Needs a physical device to properly test the step detecting feature because testing it on an emulated device is a not terribly reliable.
